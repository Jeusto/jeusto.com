I've been thinking about blogging for a few months, but I never had the motivation to actually start.
I would always go through fake productivity rabbit holes by trying to make my website perfect, collect and sort through all the ideas for blog posts that I have, etc.
I recently recreated my personal website using Docusaurus and it has made the experience of writing much more seamless and convenient.
I will discuss more about why I chose Docusaurus in a future post, but in this one I want to talk about what you can expect from this blog and what my goals are.

## Who am I?

Here's a brief introduction if you haven't read the home page of this website :

My name is Arhun Saday and I'm a student at the University of Strasbourg, in France where I'm studying computer science and I'm currently in my last year.
I also do some freelance work on the side as a full stack developer.

## Why blog?

Computer science and especially software development is a domain that is evolving constantly, which means you must be willing to learn continuously to stay up to date with new technologies and innovations.
I've always been a curious person and I love learning new things, so this doesn't bother me at all.

However, during the last year or so, I've noticed that the amount of information and knowledge I was accumulating was starting to become incredibly high.
I usually use Notion to take notes and keep track of things I've learned and I use bookmarking apps to store important or useful stuff that I find online.
But these things are kept private and will never see the light of day.
That's why I decided to start blogging, to share my discoveries and knowledge with the community and help others learn and grow.

I particularly like the blogging style of [Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/) and [Joshua Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/). Their articles feature various interactive components and I think it's a great way to make the content more engaging and fun to read.
I will try to do the same in my most important posts.

## What to expect from this blog

On this blog, I want to write different types of posts including guides, tutorials, thoughts and opinions. I will also write about my personal projects and the challenges I face while working on them.
I will cover topics that I'm passionate about or interested in, including:

- Computer science
- Software development
- Web development
- Technology
- Design

The target audience will be mainly beginners or intermediate software developers, however depending on the article it could potentially be read by anyone who is interested in the topic discussed.
Of course nothing is set in stone and this blog will probably evolve a lot over time as I make career choices and/or my interests change.

## My goals for this blog

I think, it's important to set a few goals, especially when you're starting something new.
That's why I want to share the main ones that I have for this blog:

- Document and reinforce my learning and understanding by having to dig deeper and really understand the topic I'm writing about. As the famous saying goes: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
- Improve my communication and writing skills (especially technical writing in English).
  These two "soft skills" are very important in the software development industry and I want to improve them as much as possible, especially considering English is not my native language.
  I have learned 5 languages throughout the years but I know only 3 of them really well. Azerbaijani which is my native language, French that I use in my daily life and English for everything related to entertainment and software development.
  I feel pretty comfortable with English but I know I can still improve a lot.
- Increase my online presence and build a personal brand that I can use to get more opportunities in the future, whether it's freelance work or a full time job.
- And of course, share my knowledge with the community and help others learn and grow as a developer.

## Why not use existing platforms?

I've thought about using platforms like Medium, [Dev.to](http://dev.to/), Hashnode etc.
Even though these platforms share the advantage of having an existing of community, I decided against using them for a few reasons:

- I want to have full control over my content and my website and I don't want to be dependent on the choices that a third party platform makes especially since these websites might not be around forever.
- Most of these platforms have a primary objective of making money, and they all eventually start to monetize their platform by showing ads or by charging for premium features.
  I don't want to be a part of that [nonsense](https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1097584328962240512). I just want to write and share my thoughts.
- I want to be able to include custom interactive components to a blog post whenever I want to which is not possible on these platforms.
